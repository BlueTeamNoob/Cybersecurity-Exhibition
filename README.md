 Giving a short talk on cybersecurity in the company

As a student of DAW and self-student of Cybersecurity, the company asked me to give a short talk about cybersecurity for
the workers on the factory floor.

Although it is true that it is not a very in-depth talk and does not cover topics such as hacking with USB, I wanted to
make workers more aware of the dangers they face, as this is one of the main problems: lack of knowledge.

In this talk, one of the main pillars is the use of phishing and there is a brief introduction to the use of social
engineering used by cybercriminals to achieve their ends. In fact, I have received examples of phishing myself in my
email and mobile phone.

In the future, I would like to give a talk to the staff of the office, where the server is located, to raise awareness
about the protection of internet ports, SQL injections, the use of passwords and managers and general good practice.

This was my first talk and, although I know that there are many topics to cover, the company did not want me to go into
too much depth and did not allow me time to do so, in any case, this brief presentation may be useful as an introduction
to cybersecurity in the company.
